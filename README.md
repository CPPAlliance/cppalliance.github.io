# Mission

The C++ Alliance promotes and supports the C++ language community.

## Activities

The organization achieves its mission through these means:

* Fund open source libraries
* Organize and support C++ conferences and community activities
* Support and promote WG21 proceedings
* Provide C++ education

## Our Vision

Mankind has become increasingly reliant on software for all aspects
of life including commerce, industry, recreation, transportation,
communication, and more. We believe that the best software solutions
are written using the C++ programming language. We believe that
software and knowledge are best developed and published using the
"open source" model: software for which the original source code
is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified
without restriction.

Our organization is dedicated to helping C++ evolve not only through
the language specification but also through the ecosystem of open
source libraries and talented individuals who make open source
contributions.
