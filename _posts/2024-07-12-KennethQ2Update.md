## Project Overview: Boost.io Website Development

During the second quarter of 2024, my primary focus has been on the development and enhancement of the new [boost.io](https://boost.io/) website. This project has been a significant undertaking, aimed at improving the online presence of the Boost C++ Libraries and providing a more user-friendly experience for our community.

### Key Accomplishments:

#### Onboarding to the C++ Alliance and Boost.io Repository

Being a newer member of the team, I've been getting onboarded onto the [website-v2 repo](https://github.com/boostorg/website-v2) and helping other new members of the team get onboarded as well.

Thankfully, the code quality in this repository is pretty high, so there's little concern in this department.

#### Website Usability

I spent a lot of time this quarter improving the usability of the website in subtle ways. Cleaning up the navigation, library titles, adding compatibility redirects to support URLs that were live on the [boost.org] website, etc.

#### Developer Experience

While there remains a lot of work in this area, I've done a few things like integrating [uv](https://astral.sh/blog/uv) into the build process to help speed up CI builds. In the future, I plan to use its `pip compile` functionality, too.

#### Documentation Experience Improvements

I spent a reasonable amount of time this quarter focusing on improving the navigation and usability of the [boost.io](https://boost.io/) websiteâ€™s support of arbitrary documentation.

Some clever improvements have been put in place to ensure that the user experience remains ideal as we continue to improve the solution, overall.

Hosting documentation is not without its complexities.

## Looking Forward:

Working on this project has deepened my understanding of Django and web development best practices. The collaborative nature of the C++ Alliance, especially in its remote setting, has been instrumental in overcoming challenges and driving innovation in our approach to presenting Boost libraries to the community.

I look forward to continuing to work on these projects and enjoy helping to make the world a better place!
